# A selection of my Data Science MSc projects
This repository contains a representative selection of the various projects I have worked on throughout the Data Science Msc.

## Bayesian Machine learning 
Coursework mark: `95.5%`

[Bayesian linear regression example.ipynb](https://github.com/ChrisMcD0nagh/Data-Science-MSc-project_selection/blob/main/Bayesian%20Machine%20Learning/Bayesian%20linear%20regression%20example) is an example of Bayesian linear regression to predict the heating load of buildings given structural quantities. This was the highest scoring work in the cohort of 75 students. 

I am curently undertakin a reserach project that leverages Bayesian machine learning, using surrgoate modeeling for latent paramater estimation in a variety of scientific processes. This work is supervised by Dr. Xi Chen and his prior work which my current reserach extends can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08898).

## Reinforcement Learning
Coursework mark: `70.0%`

[DQN_agent.ipynb](https://github.com/ChrisMcD0nagh/Data-Science-MSc-project_selection/blob/main/Deep%20reinforcement%20learning%20example/DQN_agent_no_tgt.py) is an  example of using neural networks for reinforcement learning (known as deep reinforcement learning). The project invovled training a [lunar module](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) to land safely using fundamental reinforcement learning method, a deep Q-network, to approximate the lunar modules value function.

## Machine learning 
Coursework mark: `90.0%`

This folder contains several python scripts that were used in coursework that involved predicting crop yields using temperature and rainfall data. [algorithms.py](https://github.com/ChrisMcD0nagh/Data-Science-MSc-project_selection/blob/main/Machine%20learning%20example/algorithms.py) contains the algorithms (coded from scratch) that were used an compared for this project - linear regression, regression forest, Gaussian process and K-means. [optimsers.py](https://github.com/ChrisMcD0nagh/Data-Science-MSc-project_selection/blob/main/Machine%20learning%20example/optimisers.py) contains the 3 algorithms used for optimising the hyper-parameters of the algorithms: brute force, Bayesian optimisation using a surrogate Gaussian process and maximum likelihood estimation. [Data ingestion, processing and algorithm evaluation.ipynb](https://github.com/ChrisMcD0nagh/Data-Science-MSc-project_selection/blob/main/Machine%20learning%20example/Data%20ingestion%2C%20processing%20and%20algorithm%20evaluation.ipynb) contains the exploratory data analysis and comparison of algorithm performance and runtime.

## SQL server interaction 
Coursework mark: `97.5%`

This coursework invovled designing a backend to server to record traffic data, focussing on interacting with an SQL database to store and organsie data.
[server.py](https://github.com/ChrisMcD0nagh/Data-Science-MSc-project_selection/blob/main/SQL%20server%20interaction%20example/server.py) conatins the code that defines the website functionality.
